To build out your database service layer effectively for the models provided in your database schema, I’ll recommend a structure that ensures modularity, maintainability, and scalability. The service layer will handle interactions with your database models—User, Stock, Stock Daily Price, Stock Intraday Price, Trading Service, and Trading Transaction—while keeping related operations grouped logically. Below, I’ll outline how many files you should create and what each file will be responsible for, based on the schema you provided.
Recommended Number of Files: 5
For your database service layer, I suggest creating five service files, each corresponding to a logical grouping of your models and their responsibilities. Here’s the breakdown:
user_service.py – Manages the User model.
stock_service.py – Manages the Stock model.
price_service.py – Manages both Stock Daily Price and Stock Intraday Price models.
trading_service.py – Manages the Trading Service model.
transaction_service.py – Manages the Trading Transaction model.
This structure balances granularity and cohesion, ensuring each service has a clear purpose while grouping related functionality together. Let’s dive into the details of each file and why this organization makes sense.
Service Layer Structure and Responsibilities
1. user_service.py – User Management
Purpose: Handles all operations related to the User Model.
Responsibilities:
Create, update, delete, and retrieve user records.
Manage user authentication (e.g., validating password_hash).
Update user status (is_active, is_admin) and track last_login.
Why a separate file?: Users are a standalone entity with distinct logic (e.g., authentication and authorization) that doesn’t overlap heavily with other models.
2. stock_service.py – Stock Information Management
Purpose: Manages the Stock Model.
Responsibilities:
Create, update, delete, and retrieve stock records (e.g., symbol, name, sector).
Toggle stock status (is_active).
Provide stock lookup functionality by symbol or other attributes.
Why a separate file?: Stocks are a core entity in your application, and their basic information is distinct from price data or trading operations.
3. price_service.py – Price Data Management
Purpose: Manages both the Stock Daily Price Model and Stock Intraday Price Model.
Responsibilities:
Insert, update, and query daily price data (open_price, close_price, volume, etc.).
Insert, update, and query intraday price data (timestamp, interval, etc.).
Validate stock_id references to ensure price data ties to existing stocks.
Handle bulk operations for price data (e.g., importing historical data).
Why combined into one file?: Both daily and intraday price models are closely related, as they represent price data for stocks. Combining them into a single service simplifies managing price-related logic and reduces redundancy, especially since they share similar fields and purposes.
4. trading_service.py – Trading Instance Management
Purpose: Manages the Trading Service Model.
Responsibilities:
Create, update, delete, and retrieve trading service instances.
Manage service state (state, mode, is_active) and financial metrics (initial_balance, current_balance, etc.).
Handle trading logic like buy/sell thresholds, stop-loss, and profit-taking rules.
Why a separate file?: Trading services are central to your application’s functionality (automated trading), and their logic is complex enough to warrant a dedicated service.
5. transaction_service.py – Transaction Management
Purpose: Manages the Trading Transaction Model.
Responsibilities:
Create, update, and close individual transactions (purchase_price, sale_price, etc.).
Calculate gain_loss when transactions are closed.
Track transaction states (OPEN, CLOSED, CANCELLED) and timestamps (purchase_date, sale_date).
Validate service_id and stock_id references.
Why a separate file?: Transactions are the granular actions within a trading service. Separating them allows focused management of transaction-specific logic, such as state transitions and profit/loss calculations.
Why Five Files?
This structure is designed based on domain responsibilities and model relationships:
Granularity: Each service has a clear, distinct role, making it easier to maintain and test.
Cohesion: Related models (e.g., daily and intraday prices) are grouped together to avoid unnecessary file proliferation.
Scalability: As your application grows, you can split services further (e.g., separate DailyPriceService and IntradayPriceService) if needed, but five files provide a solid starting point.
Here’s how the models map to the files:
User Model → user_service.py
Stock Model → stock_service.py
Stock Daily Price Model + Stock Intraday Price Model → price_service.py
Trading Service Model → trading_service.py
Trading Transaction Model → transaction_service.py
Handling Relationships and Dependencies
Your models have relationships (e.g., foreign keys), so services will need to interact:
price_service.py will depend on stock_service.py to validate stock_id before adding price data.
trading_service.py and transaction_service.py will work together, as transactions are tied to trading services via service_id.
Services can import each other or pass data as needed (e.g., TransactionService might query TradingService to check current_balance).
To keep coupling loose, consider passing only necessary data (e.g., IDs or minimal objects) rather than making services tightly dependent.
Additional Considerations
Base Service Class: You might want a base_service.py file with a BaseService class that all services inherit from. This could handle common tasks like database session management or event emission (e.g., emitting a stock_created event after a stock is added). For now, this is optional and can be added later if needed.
Enums: The enumeration types (ServiceState, TradingMode, etc.) don’t require separate service files but will be used within the relevant services (e.g., state in trading_service.py).
Final Answer
To interact with the models in your database schema, you should create five files in your database service layer:
user_service.py – For managing users.
stock_service.py – For managing stock information.
price_service.py – For managing daily and intraday price data.
trading_service.py – For managing trading service instances.
transaction_service.py – For managing individual transactions.
This structure provides a clean, organized foundation for your service layer, aligning with your schema’s models and relationships. If you need guidance on implementing specific operations within these files, let me know!
